; ReadSignedADC0
;  
;Description:        
;  Read Channel 0 of ADC, scale it using qK and put results in qADValue.
;  Do not call this routine until conversion is completed.
;
;  ReadSignedADC0 range is qK*(-1.0 ->0.9999).
;
;  Scaling constant, qK, must be set elsewhere such that
;         iResult = qK * ADCBUF0
;
;Functional prototype:
; 
; void ReadSignedADC0( tReadADCParm* pParm ) : Calculates signed value qK -> qK
;
;On Entry:   ReadADCParm structure must contain qK. ADC channel 0
;            must contain signed fractional value.
;
;On Exit:    ReadADCParm will contain qADValue
;
;Parameters: 
; Input arguments: None
;
; Return:
;   Void
;
; SFR Settings required:
;         CORCON.SATA  = 0
;     If there is any chance that Accumulator will overflow must set
;         CORCON.SATDW = 1  
;
; Support routines required: None
;
; Local Stack usage: None
;
; Registers modified: w0,w4,w5
;
; Timing: 13 cycles
