; MeasCompCurr
;  
;Description:        
;  Read Channels 1 & 2 of ADC, scale them as signed fractional values 
;  using qKa, qKb and put the results qIa and qIb of ParkParm. 
;
;  Specifically the offset is used to correct the raw ADC by
;         CorrADC = ADCBUFn - Offset
;
;  Do not call this routine until conversion is completed.
;
;  Scaling constant, qKa and qKb, must be set elsewhere such that
;         qIa = qKa * CorrADC1
;         qIb = qKb * CorrADC2
;
;Functional prototypes:  
;         void MeasCompCurr( void );
;         void InitMeasCompCurr( short Offset_a, short Offset_b );
;
;On Start:   Must call InitMeasCompCurr.
;
;On Entry:   MeasCurrParm structure must contain qKa & qKb. ADC channels 1 & 2
;            must contain signed fractional value.
;
;On Exit:    ParkParm will contain qIa & qIb.
;
;Parameters: 
; Input arguments: None
;
; Return:
;   Void
;
; SFR Settings required:
;         CORCON.SATA  = 0
;     If there is any chance that Accumulator will overflow must set
;         CORCON.SATDW = 1  
;
; Support routines required: None
;
; Local Stack usage: None
;
; Registers modified: w0,w1,w4,w5
;
; Timing: 18 cycles
